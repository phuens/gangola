          Natural Resources Development Corporation Ltd. was established in November 2007
          based on an executive order of the Royal Government of Bhutan, which was issued
          in response to the Royal Command conveyed to the 87th session of the National
          Assembly. However, its history dates back to 1979 when it was created as the
          Logging Division of the Department of Forest, Ministry of Agriculture.  In 1984,
          the Logging Division transitioned into a State-Owned Enterprise known as the
          Bhutan Logging Corporation. BLC evolved into the Forestry Development Corporation
          Limited (FDCL) in 1996 with the assignment of additional commercial mandates,
            before settling into its present state as the NRDCL in 2007.{'\n\n'}

            NRDCL is a fully-owned Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) company.
            The company is governed by the Articles of Incorporation under the Companies
            Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan 2016.
